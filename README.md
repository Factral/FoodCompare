## Purpose

The **FoodCompare** software will enable users to compare food offers from various online platforms to find the best options that meet their nutritional needs. The application gathers information about food sales from multiple *e-commerce* sites and online supermarkets, **comparing them based on prices, quality, ratings, and other relevant criteria.**

The application's functionality allows users to search for specific foods and view different available options online, along with detailed information on price, estimated delivery time, seller, and user ratings. Additionally, users can apply filters based on preferences such as brand, food type, dietary restrictions, and other relevant criteria to personalize their experience.

**FoodCompare** also empowers users to rate the service quality and food quality of different online vendors, enabling them to share experiences and assist others in making informed decisions on where to purchase their food online.

The application's primary focus is to provide accurate and up-to-date information on online food sales, helping users make informed decisions to meet their nutritional needs. It is important to note that **FoodCompare** does not offer food delivery services nor does it control the quality of the food sold by vendors.

## Version

The current version of the application is **1.0.0**.
